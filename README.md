# Prepr-FullStackChallenge
Made as part of the prepr full stack challenge

Hi, I was not familiar with Laravel before attempting this challenge. Since it was a requirement for this challenge, I chose to learn the basics and achieve the goals of this challenge. I managed to make a platform that functioned as described in the directive and used laravel. 

I did not get to spend as much time on this project as I would have liked because of academic constraints and approaching finals. I found laravel to be a very powerful and useful tool and I'm excited to learn and creat with it. Bootstrap CSS was not funtioning for the auth ui login, register, and welcome pages. Due to lack of time, I couldn't fix it. Some pages are just HTML but they are functioning as required. I realized I could change the look anytime, a functioning project has higher priority.

I used the ui:auth for Laravel to register and log in users. I used SQLite as the backend database to store user information (Screenshot provided). 

I used the provided spreadsheet of locations to create a google map and embedded it in the welcome page. I thought of that as the most efficient and clean way to approach this problem, considering the amount of time I had. This approach is obviously not very secure, since the map needed to be public to be embedded. Admin capabilities can be added by using a google sheets api and allowing the admin to enter information through the admin portal. Admin functionality wasn't added due to time constraints.

I have provided screenshots for each screen.

You can run the project through "php artisan serve" in the project directory or through any local server.
